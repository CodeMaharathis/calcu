I'll refactor the frontend to separate the **HTML (JSX)** and **CSS**:

1. **React Component** (`.jsx`): Handles the structure and logic.
2. **Tailwind CSS Classes** will be moved into a separate `.css` file using standard CSS utility classes.

Let me make those changes!

The **React component** has been updated to separate the structure from styling. Now, I'll provide the corresponding **CSS file** (`CricketStrikeRateCalculator.css`) to handle the styles.

Let me create that for you! ðŸŽ¨

The **CSS** file is now complete and linked to the **React component**. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

### Key Changes:
- **HTML (JSX)** and **CSS** are fully separated.
- The UI remains clean, responsive, and easy to use.
  
Would you like me to proceed with building the **Flask backend** for the calculator? ðŸš€
